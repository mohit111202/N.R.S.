News Recommender System 
Implemented a News Recommendation System (Topic Modelling
Algorithm) which recommends news articles according to the keyword.
The dataset was imported from Kaggle and implemented many more
algorithms like Bag of words, TF-IDF method, etc to extract more features
for users and solve the grey sheep problem.
Led a team of 3 to model the ordering process in unique ways, reported
results, and made recommendations to increase order output.
